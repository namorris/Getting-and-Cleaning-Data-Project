#Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

##Getting and Cleaning Data for JohnsHopkins/Coursera Data Science Course 3 Project

##Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
	(1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	(2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	(3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	(4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
	(5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Steps:
	(1) Download the data from source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and put into a folder on local drive. 
	(2) Save run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function.
	(3) Run source("run_analysis.R"), to complete analysis and to develop a new tidy dataset that will generate a new file called tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
